<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A puzzle solver app which uses computer vision technology to distingue puzzle games and uses AI that is built using minimax and backtracking algorithms to solve them.

### Built With

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)
* [TensorFlow-tools](https://www.tensorflow.org)
* [ML Kit-tools](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit)
* [Python](https://www.python.org)


    <!-- Outcomes -->
## Overall Outcomes/Achievements
  
  1. Solving Sudoku game with android camera.
    
    * 
  
  2. Solving Tic-Tac-Toe game with android camera.
  
## How it works
  
  ### Sudoku:
  
    1. Detect objects and capture data from the camera.



    2. Use smart algorithem to process the data and solve it.
